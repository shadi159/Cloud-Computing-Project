🌿 Smart Plant Monitoring Dashboard
Smart Plant Monitoring is a cloud-based IoT and AI system designed to help users track plant health in real time. By combining live sensor data, AI-powered image analysis, MQTT communication, and visual analytics, the platform enables users to detect plant issues early, improve growing conditions, and stay engaged through gamification features.

🧠 Features
🌡 Real-time IoT sensor monitoring
Track temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity instantly.
🤖 AI image analysis
Upload a plant image and receive automated health insights such as:
Healthy, Water Stress, Pest Detection, Disease Suspected.
📡 MQTT query tool
Simulated MQTT topics to mimic real IoT communication.
📊 Analytics dashboard
See historical trends, performance charts, and summaries.
🎮 Gamification system
Daily tasks, progress tracking, points, and motivational challenges.
🔍 RAG-based smart search engine
Search academic plant-disease articles using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
🧑‍🌾 User Dashboard
Personalized plant insights, alerts, recommendations, and sensor readings.
🛠️ Admin Dashboard
Full system control: alerts, AI reports, logs, sensors, and data management.
